The mechanic of the games are customised to make the entire adventure as enjoyable as possible - avoiding sudden bumps in the progression or major roadblocks down the way.

### Player

Level up your character by killing monsters, but be careful! They hit you back - so make sure to drink a potion when you need to heal yourself.
Every time you level up, your HP increase!

### Upgrades

Upgrade your character to make it easier to kill enemies. The main upgrade is the one for click damage - more will be added with future updates.
To purchase new upgrades, press on the 'Hero' tab in the left menu.

### Pets

### Stages

Kill enough enemies to advance to the next stage, but be careful! Advancing to the next stage will make the monsters grow stronger - so make sure to prepare well before advancing.
TIP: Auto stage progress is available below the stage list
